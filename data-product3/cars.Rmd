## Gas Mileage

Show the relationship between gas mileage (`mpg`) and other factors using 
`mtcars` dataset.

Plot weight (`wt`) vs. mileage (`mpg`) with the number of cylinders (`cyl`) as 
colors and the amount of horsepower (`hp`) as the size of an individual point 
in the plot.

## Visualizing the Data

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(plotly)
plot_ly(data = mtcars, x = ~wt, y = ~mpg, 
        color = ~as.factor(cyl), size = ~hp,
        text = ~paste("Weight: ", wt, '<br>MPG:', mpg),
        type = "scatter", mode = "markers") %>%
  layout(title = "Cars")
```
